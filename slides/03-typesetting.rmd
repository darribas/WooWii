# Introduction

## Recap

Our main goal:

> To make our research as reproducable and visible as possible

This entails:

1. Sharing of code
2. Sharing of data (if possible and not proprietary nor privacy sensitive)
3. Sharing of output (presentation, article, website)

## The power of plain text

1.  Ubiquitous
2.  Usually small in size 
3.  Portable across platforms (and versions)
    + it will not be obsolote soon
    + everyone can read it everywhere
4.  It is scriptable (both as input as output)
    - code is almost **always** in text format
    - **usually** data is in text format as well
    - but underlying format for output (presentation, website, tables, articles, books) **can** be text as well
    
## Manipulation of text

- Most output is based on simple text file; applications only change appearance, such as:
    - browsers
    - pdf
    
- **How** to change appearance require markup-languages
    - `HTML`
    - `LaTeX`
    - `Markdown`

# `Latex` and friends

## `LaTeX`

1. What?
    + A set of macros around `Tex`, a markup language invented by Donald Knuth  
2. How?
    + Latex is a document preparation system and document markup language. [Source: Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) 
3. Why?
    + Defacto standard in academic publishing
    + Formulae used in `HTML` pages (e.g., Wikipedia)
    + Macro's thus scriptable (whoohoo)
4. But...
    + Notation a bit cumbersome
    + For small texts a bit too much and not geared for `HTML` [(see also)](http://yihui.name/en/2013/10/markdown-or-latex/)

## A minimal example

```latex
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\begin{document}
\section{My Paper}
I just discovered that:
\begin{equation}
e=mc^2
\end{equation}
\end{document}
```

## Bibtex

+ Basically a free reference manager (actually more a style of managing references)
+ Very versatile and very powerful (most other markup languages work with bibtex as well)
+ Free managers, such as bibdesk or mendeley, are now ubiquitous

# Markdown

## Why markdown?

1. Easy to learn [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
2. Much less notation than Latex . Originally, 
+ `LaTeX` is for paper (aka dead trees)
+ `Markdown` is for `HTML` (blogs, wikipedia and so)
+ but sneakily uses some Latex when needed
3. Focus on text
4. Nowadays:
  + ``easily'' change it in html or pdf (via Latex)---even in Word if needed
+ can be extended with code or---much better---its results

## Small diversion

> Question 1: Why and when do we make use of pdf's and not html?

> Question 2: Is one always better than the other?

## Language syntax 

Emphasis:
```markdown
*italic* **bold**
_italic_ __bold__
```

Headers:
```markdown
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

## Language syntax (cont.)

Unordened lists
```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
+ Item 2a
+ Item 2b
```

Ordered List
```markdown
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
+ Item 3a
+ Item 3b
```

## Language syntax (cont.)

Links:
```markdown

[Cheatsheet](http://assemble.io/docs/Cheatsheet-Markdown.html)
```
Images:
```markdown
![alt text](http://example.com/logo.png)
![alt text](figures/img.png)
```

## Language syntax (cont.)

Code blocks:

```markdown
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
```

which renders as:

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

## Language syntax (cont.)

To embed mathematics 'just' use [Latex notation](https://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/training/latex/LaTeX_symbols.pdf):

```Latex
$$e=mc^2$$
```

which surprisingly looks as excel type of formulae and renders as:

$$e=mc^2$$

## Language syntax (cont.)

Inline equations just require `$ $`, e.g.: 

```Latex
In economics it is well kwown that: 
$\frac{d x}{d y} = -\frac{
\partial u(x,y)/ \partial y} {
\partial u(x,y)/ \partial x}$.
```

which renders as

In economics it is well kwown that: $\frac{d x}{d y} = -\frac{
\partial u(x,y)/
\partial y} {
\partial u(x,y)/
\partial x}$.

# Pandoc

## The swiss knife of formats

So how do we glue everything together and produce wonderful htmls and pdfs out of thin air? With **[pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)**

+ Pandoc can convert from (not extensive):
+ markdown (whoohoo), Latex, HTML, DocBook, Org-mode, and ... Words docx 
+ To (and here we go...)
+ HTML formats (including those very cool and nerdy HTML(5) slides)
+ via Latex to pdf
+ Word (but support somewhat limited) and OpenOffice formats
+ various markup formats
+ and much more

## So, a typical workflow in `R`

# The Assignment


## The assignment

- if not already done do: 
  - ```git clone https://github.com/darribas/WooWii```

- go to ```/WooWii/Paper/Assignment3/```

- and transform `RepPaper.txt` *as much as possible* in `RStudio`
- headers
- title + author
- reference (at least one is missing)
- footnotes
- table
